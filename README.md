## HackUCI Front-End Deliverable

First clone this repository, and change into the directory.


Run the command below to install all dependencies. (Animations branch uses an animation library so don't skip this)

### `npm install`


Start development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

### `npm start`


The 'master' branch includes the code that meets the requirements. You can also change to 'animations' branch to view an animation I'd add to make the page a little more fun.

### `git checkout animations`
